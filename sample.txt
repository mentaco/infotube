Infotube is a smart news ticker for your terminal. It can display information from static files or receive real-time notifications via TCP/UDP sockets.
This is a longer line to test the marquee scrolling animation of Infotube. When the text is too long to fit in the window, it will automatically start scrolling from right to left!
You can use Infotube to keep track of your tasks, study new commands, or get notified when a long-running process finishes.
Infotube supports custom colors, adjustable speed, and brightness control. Try pressing '+' or '-' to change the speed, 'b' to dim the display, and 'Space' to pause.
Infotube is built with Rust and uses the Ratatui library for its terminal user interface. Enjoy!
